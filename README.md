# Blog_generation_using_llm
 1. Used a Llama2 model for the tuning [due to memory limitations]
 2. Used LoRA, Q-LoRA for the tuning of LLms
 3. Compared it to the current state-of-the-art Llama3.2 model

#Features
 1. User can manually enter the number of words required.
 2. Contains three styles {Common, Tech Enthusiast and Researcher} user can choose as per there preference.
 3. Efficient than using normal LLM as this tuned LLM takes less space and memory making it faster.

#Future Works
 1. To tune a current state-of-the-art model and deploy it.
 2. Introduce new features to it for easier and specific generation.
 3.  Use the generated data to train it more.
